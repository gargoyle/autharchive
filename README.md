# Helidon SE Auth-Service

This is an archive of an authentication service I wrote for a different project. I'm uploading it here for reference, with the following disclaimer:-

**This code should be treated as experimental and I make no claims about its suitability for any given purpose.**

You're welcome to copy this code for your own use without any limitations. However, I strongly advise that you review it **ALL** very carefully.

## Technology

This blog makes use of the [Helidon SE framework](https://helidon.io/docs/v2/#/se/introduction/01_introduction) and JWT for user authentication.

## Removed files

The code makes reference to a keypair for signing and verifying the JWT's. Although I'll never use those keys, I have still not included them in this repo.
